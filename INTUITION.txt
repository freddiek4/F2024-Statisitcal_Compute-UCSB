How to Spot When to Use binomial distribution formula?

Ask yourself:
	1.	Am I repeating the same action multiple times (fixed trials)?
	2.	Do I care about counting how many times a specific outcome happens (e.g., “heads”)?
	3.	Are there only two outcomes for each trial (success/failure)?
	4.	Is the chance of success constant for each trial?

If yes to all, use the binomial distribution formula!
