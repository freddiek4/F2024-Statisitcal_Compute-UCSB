CDF - cumulative distribution function just means you add up the probabilities (see left to right)

Standard Normal Distribution always has mean 0 and standard deviation 1

A normal distribution can have any mean and any standard deviation. The Z-score transformation is what allows us to standardize it, scaling any normal distribution down to a standard normal distribution with:


- About 68% of the data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean (between  Z = -1  and  Z = 1 ).
- About 95% of the data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean (between  Z = -2  and  Z = 2 )
- About 99.7% of the data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean (between  Z = -3  and  Z = 3 )
